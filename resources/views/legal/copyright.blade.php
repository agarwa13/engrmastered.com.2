            <h2>Copyright and DMCA Policy</h2>

            <h4>What is EngrMastered's copyright policy?</h4>

            <p>
                EngrMastered has adopted a general policy regarding copyright in accordance with the Digital
                Millenium Copyright Act of 1998. EngrMastered removes material that is the subject of a compliant
                DMCA takedown notice. Section 512 of the DMCA provides the rules for reporting copyright
                infringement and for filing a counter-notification.

                If you believe your copyright is being infringed, you can report the alleged violation.
                If your content was the subject of a takedown notice, you can submit a counter-notification.

                EngrMastered has adopted a policy of, in appropriate circumstances, terminating user accounts that
                are repeat infringers of the intellectual property rights of others. EngrMastered also may terminate
                user accounts based on even a single infringement.
            </p>


            <h4>How do I report a copyright violation?</h4>

            <p>If you're not sure whether material on EngrMastered infringes on your copyright, please consult with
                an attorney before filing a DMCA notification. Misrepresenting that material infringes on your
                copyright may subject you to liability for damages, including costs and attorneys' fees incurred by
                content submitters or other parties.</p>

            <p>If you believe that your copyright is being infringed, you can file a DMCA notification by emailing us at nikhil@engineeringmastered.com. Your claim must include the following
                information:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>an electronic or physical signature of the person authorized to act on behalf of the owner of
                    the copyright interest;
                </li>
                <li>a description of the copyrighted work that you claim has been infringed;</li>
                <li>a description of where the material that you claim is infringing is located on the Site,
                    sufficient for EngrMastered to locate the material;
                </li>
                <li>your address, telephone number, and email address;</li>
                <li>a statement by you that you have a good faith belief that the disputed use is not authorized by
                    the copyright owner, its agent, or the law; and
                </li>
                <li>a statement by you that the information in your notice is accurate and, under penalty of
                    perjury, that you are the copyright owner or authorized to act on the copyright owner's behalf.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p>Submitting your notification via email to nikhil@engineeringmastered.com is the fastest way to file your claim.

            <h4>What happens if I receive a DMCA notification about my content?</h4>

            <p>If EngrMastered receives a DMCA notice about your content, our policy is to remove the infringing
                material or disable access to your content until the dispute is resolved or the DMCA process is
                complete. You will receive an email from EngrMastered attaching the alleged copyright owner's notice
                and
                providing instructions for filing a counter-notification. EngrMastered will process DMCA
                notifications
                and counter-notifications that it receives, but we cannot adjudicate these disputes.</p>

            <h4>How do I file a counter-notification to dispute the claims?</h4>

            <p>If you receive a DMCA notification and believe that your work has been removed or disabled by mistake
                or
                because of misidentification, you can submit a counter-notification to EngrMastered's copyright agent
                by
                emailing us at nikhil@engineeringmastered.com. Your counter-notification email must contain the following
                information (please confirm these requirements with your legal counsel or see the U.S. Copyright
                Act, 17

                </li><li>the subscriber's name, address, telephone number, and a statement that the subscriber consents
                    to the
                    jurisdiction of the Federal District Court for the judicial district in which the address is
                    located, or
                    if the subscriber's address is outside of the United States, for any judicial district in which
                    the
                    service provider may be found, and that the user will accept service of process from the person
                    who

                notification that the owner has filed an action seeking a court order. </p>
