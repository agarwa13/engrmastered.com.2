                    You are not allowed to and agree not to use any of the solutions, answers, materials or information
                    available on or through the website, whether in whole or part, to cheat. Examples include:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Using our services to complete homework when instructed not to use outside help.</li>
                    <li>Any other violation of your instructor's or school's academic honor code.</li>
                </ol>

                <p>
                    As current and former students, the EngrMastered.com team understands the pressures and time
                    constraints school creates. That being said, we also know from the unfortunate tales of our peers
                    that the risk you take by violating your school or your professor’s code of academic integrity is
                    not worth the reward. Copying promotes completion without comprehension, and that’s something we
                    don’t support on this site.
                </p>
